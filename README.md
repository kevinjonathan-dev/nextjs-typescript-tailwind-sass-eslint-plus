This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), but with some cool stuffs added. This integration with all the good things lasted me for hours so I decided to save yours.

## Cool Stuffs
- NextJS
- Typescript
- Tailwind CSS
- React-responsive
- Sass/SCSS (with absolute imports)
- ESLint (with custom strict settings)
- Prettier (configured to work with ESLint)
- Neat project structure (Components, assets, utils, etc.)
- Absolute module imports (import image1 from 'assets/image1.jpg')
- Custom SCSS functions that allows easy pixel-perfect with the design
- Custom scripts (yarn start for next dev, and yarn serve for next start)
